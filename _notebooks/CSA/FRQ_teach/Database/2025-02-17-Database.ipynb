    "## Intro to Databases\n",
    "- A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used in almost every application today, from websites to banking systems, and even scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Need Databases?\n",
    "Before databases, data was stored in files, leading to:\n",
    "- Redundancy: The same data was stored multiple times.\n",
    "- Inconsistency: Different versions of data in different files.\n",
    "- Data Isolation: Hard to retrieve and manipulate related data.\n",
    "- Security Issues: Difficult to restrict access to sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases solve these problems by organizing data in a structured way, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and security."

    "\n",
    "**1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)**\n",
    "- Data is stored in tables (rows and columns).\n",
    "- Uses Structured Query Language (SQL).\n",
    "- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. NoSQL Databases**\n",
    "- Designed for unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "- Good for big data and real-time applications.\n",
    "- Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Hierarchical Databases**\n",
    "- Data is stored in a tree-like structure (parent-child relationship).\n",
    "- Example: IBM Information Management System (IMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Network Databases**\n",
    "- More flexible than hierarchical databases, allowing many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "- Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Object-Oriented Databases**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Features of DBMS:**\n",
    "- **Data Abstraction**: Hides complex storage details from users.\n",
    "- **Data Independence**: Changes in structure do not affect applications.\n",
    "- **Data Security**: Provides authentication and authorization.\n",
    "- **Concurrency Control**: Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously.\n",

    "For a database transaction to be reliable, it must follow ACID properties:\n",
    "- **Atomicity**: A transaction is either fully completed or not executed at all.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensures that the database remains in a valid state.\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Transactions occur independently.\n",
